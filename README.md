# AI-Powered To-Do List PWA

A minimal, fast, and mobile-friendly **Progressive Web App** for managing tasks.  
Designed for real-world use with **AI-assisted task parsing** and **Firestore-powered real-time sync**.

## Features

- **AI-Assisted Task Creation**  
  Add tasks in natural language â€” the app uses AI to automatically extract:
  - Task title  
  - Participants  
  - Due dates (in ISO 8601)  

- **Real-Time Updates**  
  All tasks are stored in **Firebase Firestore**, so changes sync instantly across devices.

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**  
  - Installable on iOS, Android, and desktop.
  - Works offline after the first load.

- **Task Management**  
  - **Mark tasks as completed** *(currently deletes them, but planned upgrade to status tracking)*  
  - **Delete tasks** outright if no longer relevant.

- **Simple, Clean UI**  
  Built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS with shadcn**, and **Firebase Hosting**.
